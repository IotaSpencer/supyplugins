# Tail

This is a rewritten version of most Tail plugins available.

This version of tail uses JSON to hold its files, a previous version of this rewritten plugin used YAML but JSON is in the main python library.

Before that, the original plugin used supybot/limnoria's built-in configuration tree as data storage, only allowing a limited set of features.
