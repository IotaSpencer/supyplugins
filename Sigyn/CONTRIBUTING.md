# Contributing

We follow the standard fork and pull request model. Make an issue before
submitting a PR, so we can track discussions separate from code reviews. Open
PRs against the master branch, if it's worth backporting to release branches
then we'll cherrypick the commits from the master branch. Don't squash or rebase
commits until all code reviews and tests have passed.
