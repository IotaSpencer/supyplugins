# MsgServer

This plugin allows the sending of logs or notifications through the bot to IRC, through the use of JSON.

#### Dependencies

**Note**: This plugin is for use on Limnoria or Rasserthen(ElectroCode/IotaSpencer's Fork of Limnoria) due to the use of the internal httpserver that is not yet merged into base supybot.

* attrdict

## Usage
